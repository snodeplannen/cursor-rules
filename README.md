# Cursor Rules Rule 🚀

> ⚠️ **Important**: If you're using Cursor without rules, you're doing it wrong!

> ⚠️ **Important Part 2**: Every major update seems to slightly change how the rules work and how they need to be applied. I'm currently working on a more generalizable solution to the problem and also exploring ways to port all ideas to GitHub Copilot and Windsurf.


---

This repository contains a collection of custom rules for the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) AI coding assistant that significantly enhance its capabilities. These rules provide structure, automation, and consistency to your AI-assisted coding workflow.

## The Future of Development is Here 🌟

AI is transforming software development, and Cursor represents a significant leap forward in this evolution. This repository showcases a fundamental paradigm shift in how we build software:

**From:** Developers manually writing every line of code  
**To:** Developers creating rules and specifications that guide AI assistants to generate implementation

This approach fundamentally changes the developer's role from manual coding to:
1. Defining clear specifications for what should be built
2. Establishing technical rules for how code should be written
3. Supervising the AI as it implements solutions
4. Reviewing and refining the output

Cursor, with properly configured rules, is the first practical implementation of this new development model. The rules in this repository aren't just for code formatting or style, they establish a complete development workflow that manages everything from specifications to tasks, knowledge capture, and code commits.

By adopting this rules-based approach, developers can dramatically accelerate productivity while still maintaining control.

**And the best part?**

**You can already begin this journey with Cursor today!**

## What are Cursor Rules? 🤔

Cursor rules (in .mdc format) are instructions that guide how the AI assistant behaves, processes information, and generates code. They act as a "stdlib" or framework for the AI, ensuring that it follows best practices, coding standards, and project-specific requirements.

Rules allow you to:
- Automate repetitive tasks 🔄
- Enforce coding standards 📏
- Implement workflows that boost productivity 🚀
- Create specifications that drive implementation 📜
- Maintain consistency across your codebase 🔍

## Critical Development Principles ⚙️

All development with these rules follows these non-negotiable principles:

1. **Specifications First** 📜
   - No implementation without proper specifications
   - All user requests for new features trigger specification creation first
   - Specifications stored in structured format with proper indexing

2. **Task Tracking** 📋
   - All development activities tracked as formal tasks
   - Tasks follow proper state transitions: Open → Active → Done
   - Implementation requires formal task completion

3. **Quality Assurance** ✅
   - All code must have corresponding tests where applicable
   - No implementation considered complete without passing tests
   - Code follows project-specific style guidelines

4. **Knowledge Capture** 🧠
   - Important learnings documented during implementation
   - Solutions to complex problems captured for future reference
   - Knowledge organized and made discoverable for future use

5. **Documentation Currency** 📚
   - README and documentation kept in sync with implementation
   - Documentation updated after significant code changes
   - API documentation reflects current implementation

6. **Documentation Management** 📝
   - README automatically checked after test success
   - Documentation updated to reflect implemented features
   - API reference kept current with implementation

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this repository or download the rules
2. Place the .mdc files in your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
3. Start Cursor and begin interacting with the AI
4. The rules will automatically take effect during your conversations

For a quickstart use these commands or follow the "Practical Workflow" below!

For new projects, simply run:
```
onboard project
```

For existing projects that need analysis:
```
analyze existing
```

For just setting up the rules without analysis:
```
setup rules
```

## Practical Workflow 🔄

Follow this concrete workflow to get the most out of these rules:

1. **Initial Requirements Discussion** 💬
   - Open Cursor and describe your project/feature requirements to the AI
   - The AI will automatically create specification files in `.cursor/specs/` based on your discussion
   - A central `SPECS.md` file will be generated or updated with links to all domain-specific specs

2. **Automatic Task Planning and Management** 📅
   - Cursor AI automatically creates tasks based on your implementation requests
   - Each task receives a unique ID (e.g., TASK-2023-10-15-01) and is tracked in `.cursor/TASKS.md`
   - Tasks are automatically linked to their relevant specifications and include default acceptance criteria
   - The AI manages multiple tasks concurrently, allowing for efficient development planning

3. **Review & Refine Specifications** 🔍
   - Review the generated specs files to ensure they accurately capture requirements
   - Continue the conversation with AI to refine specs as needed
   - Each refinement will update the relevant specification files
   - Cursor AI automatically updates task details when specifications change

4. **AI-Driven Development Based on Specifications** 🤖
   - Cursor AI activates tasks when implementation begins
   - Simply ask: "Please implement the feature described in specs/auth/login.md"
   - The AI references the specs during implementation and tracks progress against the task
   - If you request a feature without specifications, the AI creates them first before implementation

5. **Automatic Knowledge Capture During Development** 🧠
   - Cursor AI identifies and records important insights during development as learnings
   - The AI documents significant discoveries, patterns, and solutions in `.cursor/learnings/`
   - Share reference documents with the AI by placing them in `.cursor/docs/`
   - All knowledge is automatically indexed in `.cursor/LEARNINGS.md` and `.cursor/DOCUMENTS.md` for future reference

6. **Automatic Documentation Updates** 📝
   - After successful tests, Cursor AI checks if README needs updating
   - Documentation is kept in sync with implementation
   - You can explicitly check README currency with `readme check` command
   - Updates are suggested based on implemented but undocumented features

7. **Automatic Commits** 💾
   - As the AI makes changes to files, the git-commit-rule automatically stages and commits them
   - Commits follow conventional commit format (feat, fix, docs, etc.) based on the nature of the change
   - Commit messages are automatically generated with appropriate type, scope, and description
   - Code is only committed after all tests pass

8. **AI-Managed Task Completion and Knowledge Preservation** ✅
   - When implementation is complete and tests pass, Cursor AI marks the task as done
   - The system updates task status, marks specs as completed, and extracts learnings
   - Learnings are preserved in `.cursor/learnings/` with references to relevant files and tasks
   - The task's status is updated in `.cursor/TASKS.md`

9. **Continuous Development Loop** 🔄
   - For new features: discuss requirements → AI generates specs → AI creates & manages tasks → AI implements → AI captures knowledge → AI updates documentation → automatic commits
   - For refinements: discuss changes → AI updates specs → AI updates tasks → AI implements changes → AI updates knowledge → AI updates documentation → automatic commits

This workflow ensures all development is specification-driven, task-organized, properly documented, and automatically committed with appropriate metadata. The integrated approach means nothing gets lost - requirements, implementation details, insights, and documentation are all preserved and linked together. You simply guide the process through conversation while Cursor AI handles the entire workflow.

## Inspiration 💡

A similar structured AI dev flow was previously implemented as a real agent system using [Flock](https://github.com/whiteducksoftware/flock) until this approach by [Geoffrey Huntley's method](https://ghuntley.com/specs/) of using Cursor AI effectively made me migrate it to Cursor and it's amazing! Huntley demonstrates how combining specifications with technical rules creates a powerful workflow that can dramatically increase development productivity.

As Huntley explains:
> "When you use '/specs' method with the 'stdlib' method in conjunction with a programming language that provides compiler soundness (driven by good types) and compiler errors, the results are incredible. You can drive hands-free output of N factor (entire weeks' worth) of co-workers in hours."

## Something Missing? 🤔

One of the most powerful aspects of Cursor is its ability to extend itself! You can ask Cursor to create new rules that address your specific workflow needs:

### How to Ask Cursor to Implement New Rules

1. **Identify a Workflow Pain Point**: Think about a repetitive task or pattern you'd like to automate

2. **Ask Cursor to Create a Rule**: Use prompts like:
   ```
   Create a Cursor IDE MDC rule that automatically [describes desired behavior].
   The rule should be saved to .cursor/rules/[rule-name].mdc
   ```

3. **Example Prompts**:
   - "Create a Cursor IDE MDC rule that automatically generates unit tests whenever I create a new function"
   - "Create a Cursor MDC rule for TypeScript files that enforces consistent error handling patterns"
   - "Create a rule that inserts license headers into new files based on file type"

4. **Refine the Rule**: Cursor will generate a rule file, but you can continue the conversation to refine it:
   ```
   That looks good, but can you modify the rule to also handle [additional case]?
   ```

5. **Test and Iterate**: Apply the rule in your workflow and ask Cursor to make adjustments as needed

This meta-capability - using Cursor to extend Cursor - demonstrates the true power of rule-based AI assistance. You're not limited to the rules in this repository; you can create a completely customized workflow tailored to your project's needs.

## "But Other AI Tools Also Have Rules!" 🤷‍♂️

Yes, I'm aware that tools and IDEs like GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, and similar AI assistants offer various forms of rules or custom instructions. However, after extensive testing of these alternatives, Cursor stands apart by enabling a rule system sophisticated enough to transform it into a proper agent.

For example, Copilot and similar tools are inherently constrained by the VS Code extension sandbox and are limited by design in what they can accomplish. These limitations prevent the creation of truly comprehensive development workflows.

What makes Cursor uniquely powerful is its ability to:
- Trigger any rule based on any event
- Execute any action in response
- Create complex, interconnected rule systems
- Operate without arbitrary sandbox limitations

This unbounded set of possibilities transforms Cursor from a mere coding assistant into an AI development partner that can manage entire workflows from specifications to implementation to documentation.

Feel free to share your experiences if you've found similar capabilities in other tools!

"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

_In the same way, effective AI systems don't just execute code, but operate within a framework of principles and specifications that guide them toward building solutions that fulfill the true vision of what we seek to create._
